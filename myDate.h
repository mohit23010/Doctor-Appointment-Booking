  //Return: -1 if the instance is ealier than secondDate
  //         0 if the instance is the same date as secondDate

  //Name: toLongDate
  //Description: creates a string for the date using the actual month name
  //             for example 1/2/2012 would return January 2, 2012

  //Description: Code included for your convenience: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WRITE THIS FUNCTION
  //This function will return the string version of the integer it is passed

//Name: operator<<
//Description: writes out the date in the form month/day/year hours:minutes
//Parameters:  ostream output - IN/OUT the stream written to
//             myDate date - IN - the date to write
//Return:     ostream - the stream written to

//Description: Expects the user to enter a date in the form month/day/year
//             reads ONLY the date part not the time
//Parameters:  istream input - IN/OUT the stream read from
//             myDate date - OUT the date to fill
